# coalescents
Scripts for simulating coalescents and analysing the output. 

The scripts are part of a manuscript currently undergoing peer-review.  Citation information will appear in due course. 


# Example

The  example file codexample.sfs  contains  examples for compiling and  running the code and   generating  simulated datapoints and comparing them to  data.

Note that  depending on the number of  points in the grid of parameter values,  the simulations can take a while, easily several days.  

The main requirements are  a  C++ compiler (e.g. g++ version 8.3.0),  Python version 3.7.3,  and GSL (GNU Scientific Library) version 2.5. 
The code compiles successfully on a Linux Debian 4.19.0-10-amd64 x86-64 architecture.
